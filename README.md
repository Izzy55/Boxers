There are many boxing enthusiasts who place bets on the outcomes of fights and make a significant amount of money off this industry.  They are always looking for ways to maximize their betting success rates and optimize financial gain.  

In this project I was seeking to identify biometric characteristics and performance statistics that closely correlate with the fighters win percent and can be combined to build a model that accurately predicts the outcome of a future fight.  I attempted to use these variables to build a predictive model that matches 2 fighters and predicts a winner.

This project was met with limited success.  My final conclusions to end this project were as follows:

The correlations between the metrics observed and win percentages of the fighters were not strong.  This needs to be considered in the confidence granted to the prediction models created, regardless of the strength of the techniques used.  Bad data in will always create bad data out.  The statistical analysis demonstrated a need for greater complexity of measurement to improve the ability to confidently predict the eventual winner of a fight with accuracy.  

My future recommendations would be to focus more on the effectiveness of a fighter’s punch and the accuracy of their landing.  Examples data collection techniques would include:

•	Using sensor technology to measure impact forces of a fighter’s punch landing
•	Measurement of the fighter’s accuracy in making impact at the primary body sites of greatest vulnerability
•	Swing speed and avoidance reaction time

These types of measurement would better determine the effectiveness of a fighter rather than just general frequency.  General frequency metrics could be considered poor predictors of a fighters potential to win a fight due to the fact that many ineffective punches will never deliver the same effective result as one strong, forceful, accurate, and impactful blow.

Effectiveness measurements such as the ones suggested above would also eliminate the need to measure general biometric data because, determination of effectiveness would always supersede biometric data in terms of importance in a predictive model.  For example, and very small but effective fighter would make his size irrelevant
